Weekly Instagram password changer


Welcome to my first git program!

Inspired by Atomic Habits by James Clear I made this program that
changes your Instagram password weekly to boost your productivity!

I made this to run on a Raspberry Pi locally and plan to make another program
that will send me that new password on Friday afternoon for weekend use!

If you want to use this make sure you do 2 things.

1. replace the username variable with your Instagram username.

2. make a .txt file named hello.txt in your directory to read and store
   old and new passwords the program creates.
