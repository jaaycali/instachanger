Weekly Instagram password changer


Welcome to my first git program!

Inspired by Atomic Habits by James Clear I made this program that
changes your Instagram password weekly to hopefully boost your productivity during the week!

I made this to schedule on a Raspberry Pi, so please excuses the long sleeps.

I do plan to make another program that will email me that new password on Friday afternoon for weekend usage.

*If you want to use this make sure you do 2 things.*

1. replace the username variable with your Instagram username.

2. make a .txt file named hello.txt in your directory to read and store
   old and new passwords the program creates.
